Blablabla

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Please install and/or load the `woRkshoptools` package.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
We always recommend using the `easypackages` packages, which can be installed with the command `install.packages("easypackages")`. After loading the package with `library(easypackages)` you can load *and* install packages (if necessary) with one command: `easypackages::packages("fancy_package_1", "fancy_package_2", ...)`
```

```{r first.exercise, solution = TRUE}
easypackages::packages(
  "StefanJuenger/woRkshoptools"
)
```
