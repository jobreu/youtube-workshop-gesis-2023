## About you

- What's your name?  

- Where do you work?  

- What is your experience with `R`?

- Why/how do you want to use *YouTube* for your research?


---

## Prerequisites for this course

- Working version of `R` >= 4.0.0 and a recent version of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

- Some basic knowledge of `R`  

- Interest in working with *YouTube* data

---

## Workshop Structure & Materials

- The workshop consists of a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises

- Slides and other materials are available at

[https://github.com/jobreu/youtube-workshop-gesis-2023](https://github.com/jobreu/youtube-workshop-gesis-2023)

We also put the PDF versions of the slides and some other materials on the [GESIS Ilias](https://ilias.gesis.org/) repository for this course.

---

## Zoom Etiquette

- If possible, we invite you to turn on your camera (during the lecture and exercise parts); feel free to use a virtual background if you want to

```{r tweet, echo = F}
tweet_embed("https://twitter.com/PhdExhausted/status/1331956737683853318",
            theme = "dark",
            maxwidth = 400,
            align = "center")
```

---

## Zoom Etiquette

- Please mute your microphones unless you are asking a question

- Asking questions:
  - If you have an immediate question, feel free to ask it via video/audio using the "raise hand" function in *Zoom* or via the text chat (private or public)
  - If you have a question that is not urgent and might be interesting for everybody, please wait until the end of the lecture part, then use the "raise hand" function and ask your question via audio/video
  - During the exercises you can also use "raise hand" + audio/video (if you have a question that might be interesting for others as well) or public or private text chat messages to ask questions

---

## Zoom Etiquette

- We will also try to provide (one-on-one) "tech support" during the exercises if that is needed (please contact us via the text chat in case you have any technical issues/questions that we can solve)

---

## Preliminaries: Base `R` vs. `tidyverse`

In this course, we will use a mixture of base `R` and `tidyverse` code as Johannes prefers the `tidyverse`,  Annika prefers ???? `R`, and Ro is agnostic.

.small[
ICYC, here are some opinions [for](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) and [against](https://blog.ephorie.de/why-i-dont-use-the-tidyverse) using/teaching the `tidyverse`.
]

---

## The `tidyverse`

If you've never seen `tidyverse` code, the most important thing to know is the `%>%` [(pipe) operator](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html). Put briefly, the pipe operator takes an object (which can be the result of a previous function) and pipes it (by default) as the first argument into the next function. This means that `function(arg1 = x)` is equivalent to `x %>% function()`.

It may also be worthwhile to know/remember that `tidyverse` functions normally produce [`tibbles`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) which are a special type of dataframe (and most `tidyverse` functions also expect dataframes/tibbles as input to their first argument).

---

## The `tidyverse`

If you want a short primer (or need a quick refresher) on the `tidyverse`, you can check out the blog [post by Dominic Royé](https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2020/a-very-short-introduction-to-tidyverse/). For a more in-depth exploration of the `tidyverse`, you can, e.g., have a look at the [workshop by Olivier Gimenez](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/intro_tidyverse/#1). And the book [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (which is available for free online) provides a very comprehensive introduction to the `tidyverse`.

---

## Preliminaries: What's in a name?

Another thing you might notice when looking at our code is that we love `r ji("snake")` as much as `r ji("camel")`.

## Why is *YouTube* relevant?

- Important online video platform<br /><small>([Alexa Traffic Ranks, 2019](https://www.alexa.com/topsites); [Konijn, Veldhuis, & Plaisier, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2012.0357))</small>

- Esp. popular among adolescents who use it to, e.g., watch movies & shows, listen to music, and retrieve information<br /><small>([Feierabend, Plankenhorn, & Rathgeb, 2016](https://www.mpfs.de/studien/kim-studie/2016/))</small>

- For adolescents, *YouTube* partly replaces TV<br /><small>([Defy Media, 2017](http://www.newsroom-publicismedia.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Defi-media-acumen-Youth_Video_Diet-mai-2017.pdf))</small>

## Why is *YouTube* data interesting for research?

- Content producers and users generate huge amounts of data

- These data can be useful for research on media content, communicators, and user interaction

- The data are publicly available and relatively easy to retrieve via the *YouTube* API

- For some further reasons and examples, see [Arthurs et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1177/1354856517737222); [Baertl, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1177/1354856517736979)

## How to collect *YouTube* data

There are many different ways in which data from *YouTube* and other social media can be collected (see [Breuer et al., 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444820924622)):

- Manually (e.g., via copy & paste and manual content analysis)

- Using existing data, such as [*YouNiverse: Large-Scale Channel and Video Metadata from English YouTube*](https://zenodo.org/record/4650046) (also see the accompanying preprint by [Ribeiro & West, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10378))

- Automatically via the *YouTube* API or web scraping

---

## How to collect *YouTube* data

Overviews of tools for collecting *YouTube* data

- [YouTube Tools](https://smo-wiki.leibniz-hbi.de/YouTube-Tools) collected by the Leibniz-HBI Social Media Observatory

- [Social Media Research Tookit](https://socialmediadata.org/social-media-research-toolkit/) by the Social Media Lab at Ryerson University

---

## Tools for the Automatic Sampling of *YouTube* Data without `R`

- [YouTube Data Tools](https://tools.digitalmethods.net/netvizz/youtube/)

- [Facepager](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/wiki)

- [Webometric Analyst](http://lexiurl.wlv.ac.uk/)

---

## Tools for the Automatic Sampling of *YouTube* Data with `R`

- [`vosonSML`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vosonSML/) (formerly SocialMediaLab)

- [`VOSONDash`](https://vosonlab.github.io/VOSONDash/)

- [`tuber`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tuber/)

- [`youtubecaption`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/youtubecaption/)

In this course, we will work with the `tuber` package. The *voson* packages focus more on network data (and analysis) and the `youtubecaption` package is for collecting captions (which we will also briefly discuss later on in the workshop).

---

## A note on using FOSS

The tools listed before are free and open source software (FOSS). Using FOSS has many advantages (availability, adaptability, etc.). However, one risk associated with using FOSS is that tools are not maintained anymore and, hence, cease to function. After all, people create and maintain these tools in their spare time or as side projects and this work is often not recognized enough (esp. within academia). For this reason it is especially important to acknowledge the work that goes into these tools by properly citing them.
